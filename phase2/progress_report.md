# Progress Report

## Phase 0
Our project is to develop a decentralized chat room system. Currently, the specification of the project can be summarized as: a user can create their own chat room and manage the enrollment of the other users. Currently, the chatrooms only support text but in the next phases we plan to implement actions (like, react, etc.). Our CRC model highlights all classes, which all adhere to the SOLID design principles. The scenario walk-through highlighted the basic use of our program: to create a user and produce a new chartroom where we are able to send a text message. In the future, we plan to support complex scenarios. For example, to post images messages, join multiple chat rooms and ability to change user profiles



## Phase 2

In phase 2 we have finished our phase 0 goals which keep the SOLID design principles and now the chatroom supports the text and implements actions (some of the picture messages may support). We now have the accessibility on Android which is similar to Whatsapp. We did have access to use QR code to join the chat rooms.

Since our final project is aiming to run our apps on Android. We replace our command-line with “Android UI + Web Interface”

Peter and Varun has been working on the message and test cases together. They work on the factory pattern of the Message and manager. They checked the code and written test cases covered most of the code. 

Lilian was working on the repo part. The Repo class has been refactored into an interface and our JSONRepo extends the interface.

Junhao and Jackson are working together for the services and command-line. They have done significant work on the project which develops the program on the android system.
