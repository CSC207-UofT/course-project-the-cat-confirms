Principle 1: Equitable Use: No since the Owner of the chatroom has more power than the Listener, so It’s not equitable, but it’s impossible to change 
for our apps since for the security requirement.

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use: We have some flexibility that we can use this app on computer and Android, but we can’t use it on IOS so far. We will 
improve this in the future. Also our UI is monotonous, this also needs to be improved.

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use: Our app is simple and intuitive to use. It has most functions like the normal chat apps. So it’s easy for all 
users to have clear feedback on the apps.

Principle 4: Perceptible Information: Our apps have limitations on this. Since we can send the picture and Action Message, but we cannot Bolding our 
word our input Voice message so far, such that some sensory limitations can’t use our apps.

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error: We haven’t made it, we will consider this as a target in the future design.

Principle 6: Low Physical Effort: In some way, our apps need more physical effort than before. Since our chat apps is in a closed internet. 
Sometimes we need to report some information from open network. We need to copy and paste it into our program rather than other programs. 
Maybe we just need to forward to other users.

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use: We haven’t programmed this yet, this is more like a hardware requirement which we may update in our 
UI later in the future.




Target:
Our program is targeted as a decentralized chat room. This chat room is designed for companies who have highly confidential needs such as military bases 
chat service; National security; private trading; high-tech company chat services. Since it’s de-centralized, all the chat rooms are private and held by 
the owner of the chatroom. All the text messages and access to the chatroom are secure and under control by the owner. Since all the data is saved in the 
private chat room and disconnected with the global internet which means that it only worked for local internet, it will stay away from supervision and 
monitoring authorities. In other words, it is safer for the owners when compared to other chat apps.

Obviously, this app takes organizations which need high confidentiality and information security as target clients. Therefore it is not designed for the 
majority. However, there are still some limitations, i.e. if it is used for illegal purposes, the criminals can stay away from monitoring authorities.
