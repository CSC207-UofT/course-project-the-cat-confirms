# Project Accessibility Report

## Principle of Universal Design

1. Equitable Use

    Our application is released for free. For those who has a PC or Android phone, they should be able to use our application
     to send messages to different user in the same network. 
   
2. Flexibility in Use

   The front end is developed with web technologies. Therefore, the whole application is runnable on both a PC or an Android mobile device. 
   We try to place the UI components in different locations, so clicking the right component should not require too much accuracy.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use

    Each action requires less than 5 clicks to complete:
   * Create room: (from Main page) 3 clicks + 1 keyboard input
   * Join room: (from Main page)  2 clicks
   * Enter chatroom: (from Main page) 1 click
   * Send message: (from chatroom page) 1~2 clicks
   * Share room: (from chatroom page) 2 clicks

4. Perceptible Information

    Our application can support sending messages in different forms. For those who has disabilities:
     * **Visual**: all aria labels on different UI elements should help those users to use a screen reader to read and control the UI.
     * **Verbal**: no voice message is supported currently. However, if we do support such feature they still have alternative ways to send messages.
     * **Hearing**: same as **Verbal**.

5. Tolerance for Error

    We require more than 2 steps to confirm a critical action. e.g. Dropping from a chatroom

6. Low Physical Effort

    QR code is supported in sharing/joining chat rooms so that users do not have to enter a 50-charter long token to join some room. 

7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

    Users are required to be under the same network to use our application, unless they can obtain an Internet IP directly on their devices. 


## Marketing Strategy
Our application is advertised as a decentralized chat room. The application targets companies who have highly confidential needs. For example, military service,
national security, private trading, and intellectual property development. Since itâ€™s de-centralized, all the chat rooms are private and held by 
the owner of the chatroom and do not go through 3rd-party providers. All the text messages and access to the chatroom are secure and under control by the owner. 
Since all the data is saved in the private chat room and disconnected with the global internet which means that it only worked for local internet, it will stay 
away from supervision and monitoring authorities. In other words, it is safer for the owners when compared to other chat apps.

## Targeting demographics
Apparently, this app takes organizations which need high confidentiality and information security as target clients. Therefore, it is not designed for the 
general public. However, there are still some limitations and risk in operations. For example, if it is used for illegal purposes, the criminals can stay 
away from monitoring authorities.
